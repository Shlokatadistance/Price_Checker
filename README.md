The program makes use of Beautifulsoup to pull down information from the html script of the page, while requests helps carry out the other communications.

If you are a MAC user, make sure you Install the certifications, because if you dont, each and every time you want to make use of the google search within the program, it will throw a SSL error, telling you that the certifications were not found.
So in your python folders, find the 'Install.Certifications' and run the script. It will automatically start working. Certifi works too, but you have to configure your environment correctly.
